# Ethereum Solidity 101 - ERC-20 Token A beginner-friendly Ethereum smart contract project demonstrating core blockchain development concepts. ## What You'll Learn - Smart Contract Basics: State variables, functions, modifiers - ERC-20 Token Standard: Industry standard for fungible tokens - Solidity Language: Ethereum's smart contract programming language - Testing: Unit testing smart contracts for security and reliability - Deployment: Deploying to local and test networks - Gas Optimization: Writing efficient code to minimize transaction costs ## Prerequisites - Node.js (v18+ recommended) - Basic JavaScript knowledge - MetaMask wallet (for testnet deployment) ## Setup Instructions ### 1. Install Dependencies ```bash cd ethereum-solidity npm install ``` ### 2. Environment Setup (Optional - for testnet) Create `.env` file: ```bash SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID PRIVATE_KEY=your_metamask_private_key_here ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key ``` ### 3. Compile Contract ```bash npm run compile ``` ### 4. Run Tests ```bash npm run test ``` ### 5. Deploy Locally ```bash # Terminal 1: Start local blockchain npm run node # Terminal 2: Deploy contract npm run deploy:localhost ``` ### 6. Deploy to Sepolia Testnet (Optional) ```bash npm run deploy:sepolia ``` ## Project Structure ``` ethereum-solidity/ contracts/ SimpleToken.sol # Main ERC-20 token contract scripts/ deploy.js # Deployment script test/ SimpleToken.test.js # Comprehensive test suite hardhat.config.js # Hardhat configuration package.json # Dependencies and scripts ``` ## Core Concepts Demonstrated ### 1. State Management ```solidity mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf; // Persistent storage ``` ### 2. Events for Transparency ```solidity event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value); ``` ### 3. Access Control ```solidity modifier onlyOwner() { require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function"); _; } ``` ### 4. Gas Optimization - Efficient storage usage - Minimal external calls - Optimized loops and operations ## Testing Features Our test suite covers: - Contract deployment verification - Token transfer functionality - Approval and allowance mechanisms - Minting permissions - Security vulnerability prevention - Gas usage optimization - Event emission verification ## Key Blockchain Concepts 1. Immutability: Once deployed, contract code cannot be changed 2. Decentralization: No single point of failure 3. Transparency: All transactions are publicly viewable 4. Consensus: Network validates all transactions 5. Gas: Computation cost for blockchain operations ## Common Issues & Solutions ### Issue: "Insufficient balance" error Solution: Ensure sender has enough tokens before transfer ### Issue: High gas costs Solution: Optimize contract code, use efficient data structures ### Issue: Contract not deploying Solution: Check network configuration and account balance ## Next Steps 1. Extend Functionality: Add burning, pausing, or governance features 2. Security Audits: Learn about common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow) 3. Frontend Integration: Connect with Web3.js or Ethers.js 4. Advanced Patterns: Study proxy contracts, factory patterns 5. DeFi Integration: Build DEX, lending protocols ## Useful Resources - [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) - [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) - [Ethereum.org Developer Portal](https://ethereum.org/developers/) - [Hardhat Documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs) ## Job-Ready Skills Covered - Smart contract development - Solidity programming - Unit testing and audits - Gas optimization - Deployment and verification - Security best practices
