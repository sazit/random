# Bitcoin Mining Simulation Dependencies
# All standard library modules - no external dependencies required!

# The simulation uses only Python standard library:
# - hashlib (for SHA-256 hashing)
# - time (for timestamps and performance measurement)  
# - json (for data serialization)
# - dataclasses (for structured data)
# - datetime (for human-readable timestamps)

# Optional: For enhanced development experience
pytest>=7.0.0        # For running tests
black>=22.0.0         # Code formatting
mypy>=1.0.0          # Type checking

# Optional: For visualization (if you want to extend the project)
matplotlib>=3.5.0     # For plotting mining statistics
pandas>=1.4.0        # For data analysis
