# Bitcoin Mining Simulation - Python A comprehensive educational Bitcoin mining simulation demonstrating core blockchain concepts including Proof of Work, hashing, and consensus mechanisms. ## What You'll Learn - Proof of Work (PoW): Bitcoin's consensus mechanism - SHA-256 Hashing: Cryptographic foundation of Bitcoin - Block Structure: How Bitcoin blocks are organized - Transaction Validation: Ensuring transaction integrity - Mining Process: Finding valid nonces and earning rewards - Difficulty Adjustment: Maintaining consistent block times - Blockchain Validation: Ensuring chain integrity ## Prerequisites - Python 3.7+ (uses only standard library!) - Basic understanding of Python - Interest in learning blockchain fundamentals ## Setup Instructions ### 1. No External Dependencies Required! ```bash cd bitcoin-mining # The simulation uses only Python standard library # No pip install needed for core functionality ``` ### 2. Optional: Install Development Tools ```bash # For testing and code quality (optional) pip install -r requirements.txt ``` ### 3. Run the Simulation ```bash python simple_bitcoin.py ``` ### 4. Run Tests ```bash python test_bitcoin.py # Or with pytest (if installed) pytest test_bitcoin.py -v ``` ## Project Structure ``` bitcoin-mining/ simple_bitcoin.py # Main Bitcoin simulation test_bitcoin.py # Comprehensive test suite requirements.txt # Optional development dependencies README.md # This file ``` ## Core Components ### 1. Transaction Class ```python @dataclass class Transaction: sender: str receiver: str amount: float fee: float = 0.001 timestamp: float = None ``` ### 2. Block Class ```python @dataclass class Block: index: int timestamp: float transactions: List[Transaction] previous_hash: str merkle_root: str nonce: int = 0 difficulty: int = 4 ``` ### 3. Mining Process ```python def mine_block(self) -> Dict: target = "0" * self.difficulty # Proof of Work target while True: hash_result = self.calculate_hash() if hash_result.startswith(target): return mining_stats # Found valid hash! self.nonce += 1 # Try next nonce ``` ## Key Features Demonstrated ### Proof of Work Mining - Demonstrates computational difficulty - Shows nonce finding process - Calculates hash rates and mining statistics - Implements target difficulty system ### Cryptographic Security - SHA-256 hashing for all operations - Merkle tree construction for transaction integrity - Hash avalanche effect demonstration - Immutable blockchain structure ### Economic Model - Mining rewards (coinbase transactions) - Transaction fees - Balance tracking and validation - Double-spending prevention ### Dynamic Difficulty - Automatic difficulty adjustment - Target block time maintenance - Network hash rate adaptation ## Testing Coverage Our comprehensive test suite covers: - Transaction creation and validation - Cryptographic hash functions - Block mining and proof of work - Blockchain integrity validation - Balance management - Difficulty adjustment algorithms - Double-spending prevention - Merkle tree calculation ## Sample Output ``` Bitcoin Mining Simulation Started This demonstrates Proof of Work consensus and blockchain basics Creating Genesis Block... Mining block 0... Target difficulty: 4 leading zeros Transactions in block: 1 Attempt: 100,000 | Hash rate: 2,456,789 H/s | Current hash: 00001a2b3c4d5e6f7890... Block mined successfully! Winning hash: 0000a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12 Winning nonce: 187,439 Mining time: 0.76 seconds Hash rate: 246,893 H/s Total attempts: 187,439 ``` ## Educational Concepts ### Why Proof of Work? 1. Security: Computationally expensive to attack 2. Decentralization: Anyone can participate in mining 3. Consensus: Network agrees on valid blocks 4. Immutability: Past blocks become harder to change ### Mining Economics - Block Reward: Fixed reward for mining (50 BTC in simulation) - Transaction Fees: Additional revenue from including transactions - Difficulty: Automatically adjusts to maintain block times - Hash Rate: Network's total computational power ### Real Bitcoin vs Simulation | Aspect | Real Bitcoin | Our Simulation | |--------|-------------|----------------| | Block Time | ~10 minutes | ~10 seconds | | Difficulty | Very high | Low (for demo) | | Hash Algorithm | SHA-256 | SHA-256 | | Block Reward | 6.25 BTC | 50 BTC | | Network | Global | Single computer | ## Common Scenarios to Explore ### 1. Experiment with Difficulty ```python # Try different difficulty levels blockchain.difficulty = 6 # Much harder! blockchain.mine_block("miner1") ``` ### 2. Simulate Network Congestion ```python # Add many transactions for i in range(100): blockchain.add_transaction(Transaction(f"user{i}", "merchant", 1.0)) ``` ### 3. Test Security ```python # Try to create invalid transactions invalid_tx = Transaction("hacker", "target", 1000000.0) # No balance! blockchain.add_transaction(invalid_tx) # Should fail ``` ## Performance Insights - Hash Rate: Modern GPUs can achieve >100 MH/s - Energy: Real Bitcoin mining consumes ~150 TWh/year - Economics: Mining profitability depends on electricity costs - Security: Network security increases with total hash rate ## Extensions & Next Steps 1.
